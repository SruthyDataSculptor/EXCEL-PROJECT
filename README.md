EXCEL PROJECT-BIKE SALES DASHBOARDS
Bike Buyers Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and analysis of a bike buyers dataset using Excel. The dataset contains customer details such as marital status, gender, income, commute distance, and whether they purchased a bike. The project aims to gain insights into customer behavior using pivot tables, charts, and dashboards.
Data Cleaning Steps
1.	Removed Duplicates: Eliminated 26 duplicate entries.
2.	Standardized Marital Status:
o	M → Married
o	S → Single
3.	Standardized Gender:
o	M → Male
o	F → Female
4.	Formatted Income Column:
o	Converted values to currency format (e.g., $40,000)
o	Removed decimal points.
5.	Added "Age Brackets" Column:
o	Old (55+ years)
o	Middle Age (31-54 years)
o	Adolescent (Below 31 years)
6.	Standardized Commute Distance:
o	"10+ Miles" → "More than 10 Miles" (for better sorting)
Pivot Tables and Charts
1.	Average Income Analysis
o	Rows: Gender
o	Columns: Purchased Bike (Yes/No)
o	Values: Sum of Income
o	Chart: Clustered Column Chart
2.	Customer Commute Analysis
o	Rows: Commute Distance
o	Columns: Purchased Bike (Yes/No)
o	Values: Sum of Purchased Bike
o	Chart: Line Chart
3.	Customer Age Bracket Analysis
o	Rows: Age Bracket
o	Columns: Purchased Bike (Yes/No)
o	Values: Sum of Purchased Bike
o	Chart: Line Chart
Data Analysis Insights
•	Gender-Based Insights: Analyzed how gender impacts bike purchases by comparing income and purchase trends.
•	Commute Distance Impact: Identified the commute distance range where most customers buy bikes.
•	Age Bracket Preferences: Determined which age group is most likely to purchase a bike.
•	Income Influence: Investigated whether income levels affect bike purchasing decisions.
•	Trends & Patterns: Discovered key buying behavior trends through visualization and filtering.
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made to optimize bike sales and target the right customer segments:
1.	Target Middle-Aged Customers (31-54 years)
o	This age group shows a higher likelihood of purchasing bikes compared to adolescents and older customers.
2.	Focus on Customers with Short to Moderate Commutes (0-10 Miles)
o	Customers commuting shorter distances are more likely to purchase a bike. Marketing efforts should emphasize the convenience of biking over short commutes.
3.	Gender-Based Marketing Strategy
o	Male customers tend to have higher purchase rates than females. However, additional marketing strategies can be developed to attract female customers.
4.	Income Level Consideration
o	Customers with mid-to-high income levels ($40,000 and above) are more inclined to buy bikes. Targeting this segment with premium or feature-rich models may increase sales.
5.	Highlight Cost Savings and Health Benefits
o	Since commute distance plays a role in bike purchases, promoting biking as a cost-effective and healthy alternative to driving can attract more buyers.
